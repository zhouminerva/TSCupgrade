# MATLAB Simulink model for upgrading to a TSC in a 3-center system

To run simulation, download all files into same directory. 

Run stochastic.m to run the stochastic simulation.
urban_upgrade3.mat and nonurban100_upgrade3.mat is the data output from running the stochastic simulation with 1000 trials with, respectively, an interhospital distance of 10 and 100 and a service radius of 15 and 150.
Upgrade3.slx is the Simulink model file. The rest are functions to extract and analyze data from the simulation outputs.
